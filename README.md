## Overview

I have created a single-screen application that presents a "profile information" page for a user in a hypothetical social networking application using dart. Examples of such apps include professional networking and dating apps.


## Specifications

It displays a single scrollable screen containing static user information organized into multiple visually distinct sections. These sections align with the theme of the hypothetical social networking application.



## Result
